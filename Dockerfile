# Step 1: Use Maven image to build the project
FROM maven:3.9.6-eclipse-temurin-21 AS build

WORKDIR /app

# Copy pom.xml and download dependencies first (cache layer)
COPY pom.xml .
RUN mvn dependency:go-offline -B

# Copy source code and build the JAR
COPY src ./src
RUN mvn clean package -DskipTests

# Step 2: Use lightweight JDK image to run the JAR
FROM eclipse-temurin:21-jdk

WORKDIR /app

# Copy jar from build stage
COPY --from=build /app/target/*.jar app.jar

# Expose port (Render will map it dynamically, so weâ€™ll use $PORT)
EXPOSE 8080

# Start the application
ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "app.jar"]
